HobbyKingScraper

PHP script that takes battery data from HobbyKing.com and outputs it into a CSV or XLS (Excel). 
Uses Duzun's hQuery (https://github.com/duzun/hQuery.php)

This program is meant to pull data in order for a battery to be picked without having to go through all 800 batteries HobbyKing has to offer, and instead
dumps them into an Excel file so that a battery can be picked easily.
